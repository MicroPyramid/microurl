microurl
========


python library for url minification.

download this, extract/unzip and copy to your python packages folder

on linux, it must be /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/

then you can use it by importing google url shorner from microurl

from microurl import google_mini

minified = google_mini('validurl', 'Google_API_KEY')

its as simple as that.
